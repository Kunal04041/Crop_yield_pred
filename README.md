Crop Yield Prediction


This project focused on predicting the yield of various crops such as cassava, maize, plantains, rice, wheat, and others. The predictions are based on environmental factors like average temperature,average rainfall,temperature and type of crop.This project can be beneficial for practical problems where it will help to predict the yield of different crops.

Dataset used in this project is provided by world bank.
