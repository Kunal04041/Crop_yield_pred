Crop Yield Prediction


This project focused on predicting the yield of various crops such as cassava, maize, plantains, rice, wheat, and others. The predictions are based on environmental factors like soil quality, rainfall, and temperature, using datasets provided by the World Bank.

Technologies Used:



Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (XGBoost)
Data Sources: World Bank Crop Datasets


Highlights:

Collected and cleaned diverse agricultural datasets.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations between environmental factors and crop yields.
Implemented XGBoost for its efficiency in handling large datasets and accuracy in regression tasks.
